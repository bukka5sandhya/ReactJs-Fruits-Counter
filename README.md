Quick Tips

Click to view

State updates are merged. It means that when you update only one key-value pair in the state object, it will not affect the other key-value pairs in the state object.

For example let's say your state is as followed:

state = { key1 : value1, key2 : value2}

If you use this.setState such as :

this.setState(prevState => ({key1: prevState + valueN}))

Your new state will be :

state = { key1 : value3, key2 : value2 }

You can use the below cursor CSS property for buttons to set the type of mouse cursor, to show when the mouse pointer is over an element,

cursor: pointer;

You can use the below outline CSS property for buttons and input elements to remove the highlighting when the elements are clicked,

Things to Keep in Mind

All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.

Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.

Do not remove the pre-filled code
